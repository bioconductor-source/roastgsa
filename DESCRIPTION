Description: This package implements a variety of functions useful for
             gene set analysis using rotations to approximate the
	     null distribution. It contributes with the implementation of
	     seven test statistic scores that can be used with different goals
	     and interpretations. Several functions are available to complement the statistical results
	     with graphical representations.
